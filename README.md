# fitness_tracker_data_sci

This is my final capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The project analyzes fitness tracking device data to gain insights for a company called Bellabeat.

## Introduction

Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. While they are a successful small company, they have the potential to grow further and become a larger player in the wearable smart device industry. Urška Sršen, the co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device data could unlock new growth opportunities for the company.

The Bellabeat IVY+ Health Tracker is uniquely designed for women, correlating menstrual cycle data, lifestyle habits, and biometric readings to provide a comprehensive overview of well-being. The IVY+ retails on the Bellabeat website for €249.00, which is approximately $275.00. The IVY+ Health Tracker features include:

- Long Battery Life (up to 8 days)
- Pedometer
- Automatic Distance and Activity Tracker
- Calorie Tracker

- 24/7 Heart Rate Monitor

## Premise

We aim to understand how users engage with health tracking features in smart devices, specifically the Bellabeat IVY+.

### Understanding Engagement

Our goal is to determine how effectively users interact with the IVY+ and its features. This includes identifying which functionalities—such as menstrual tracking and sleep monitoring—users find valuable and which ones they may overlook or underutilize.

### Identifying Gaps

By analyzing data from other smartwatches and fitness trackers, we can identify areas where users may struggle or where their needs aren't fully met. This analysis can reveal why some users might stop using their devices, helping us pinpoint specific aspects of the IVY+ that could be improved to enhance user satisfaction and retention.

In essence, we aim to leverage data insights to create a better product experience that keeps users engaged and satisfied with the IVY+.
